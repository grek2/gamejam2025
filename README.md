game stuff goes here

UPDATE 7/11/25 - I made my own game loosely based off of what this one was supposed to be.
https://github.com/grek2/OceanGameRaylib
It's still unfinished but it's playable and I didn't use WIN32 FOR THE GRAPHICS so people who aren't Ari might be able to understand it.
-Madison

to run, run vscode in the ariprototyping/win32 cuz fuck this/ folder and compile/debug/run main.cpp

to play the other maps, change the number in line 291 of graphical.cpp to 0,1, or 2. i ran out of time to implement the actual level switching nor a win condition. so just like idk enjoy the scenery or smth idk

windows exclusive btw cuz fuck mac and linux they dont have win32 so they fucking suck lmao get owned mac users(and me whos a linux user i guess)(can you tell im incredibly sleep deprived from this fucking gamejam)(you organizers completely ruined my sleep schedule, tysm btw)

you might notice i copied some if the zelda sprites cuz low on time.
